# Cretonne Progress Notes

At this point in my project, I had successfully completed the initial process
of generating a file in the target directory. There are some problems to sort
out, and not all of the types are in place as of yet, but I do see a file in
the output directory nonetheless!

As of right now, I have the remaining tasks to complete:
*  Remove the leading 0's from each line.
   (Find out why are these being initialized in the first place)
*  Figure out why multi-line doc comments do not seem to work.
*  Fix the numbering system.
*  Remove placeholder documentation comments.
*  Fix iterator creation for the special types.
*  Once special types seem correct, flesh out the rest of the types.
