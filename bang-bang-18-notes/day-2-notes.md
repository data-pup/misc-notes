# !!Con Day 2 Notes

### Build skills through hobbies! Bring them to work! - `@lizthegrey`

"Being a senior engineer is about how much you can enable other people."

"Any call is better than no call."

communications bandwidth, rotations and scheduling roles.

intentional culture:
*  people must feel included (rockstars cannot be tolerated)
*  rockstars have the tendency to poison the well
*  giving the people the tools to succeed

"Value your trustworthiness"

__Applying this to your life__

figure out what things you want to learn:
*  what are your interests
*  what skills does your next project require
*  who/what can you learn from
*  be intentional
*  failure is a lesson

volunteer for things, communicate what you've learned, and don't be ashamed
of your interests.

be expansive in what you accept, assess skills, not how people got them.
