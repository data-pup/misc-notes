# Task Overview

This is the overview of the work to be done, described by @sunfishcode.

> The next logical step is to look at the compiler settings, and in particular
> `settings.rs`. It's generated by `gen_settings.py`, which also generates
> target-specific settings files, but we can split those out into a separate
> step. That way, we won't need the isas in this step.
>
> `/lib/codegen/meta-python/base/settings.py` shows what settings are all about.
> Note that SettingsGroup's constructor registers the created object in a static
> `_current` variable, and all the settings are automatically collected from
> Python's globals() at the end. This is an example of the "DSL" approach, and
> it does make the file a little more streamlined. A less magical approach would
> be to just add settings to a SettingsGroup object explicitly, which would also
> be more Rust-friendly.
