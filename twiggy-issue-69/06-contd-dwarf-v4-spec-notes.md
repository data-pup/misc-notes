# DWARF v4 Specification Notes (Contd.)

## Section 2

Each DIE consists of an identifying tag and a series of attributes. A single
entry, or a group of entries, provide a description of a corresponding entity
in the source program. The tag specifies the class to which an entry belongs.

Examples of some tags include `DW_TAG_variable` `DW_TAG_member`,
`DW_TAG_subprogram`, and `DW_TAG_base_type`.

NOTE: More through notes on this section are included in
